_If you are on a headless machine, you should set the **TRACKIT_HOST** environment variable to change the IP where TrackIt will listen._

## Hardware Requirement
Currently, we recommend having a minimal of 2 cores and 2GB of RAM to run TrackIt.
The disk space entirely depends on your billing file's size and your seniority on AWS. You should start with 32GB free.
We have found that an account spending $300,000 a month for 24 months in AWS takes around 50GB more.
